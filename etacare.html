                    <h2>ETACare Task Management App</h2>
                    <p>EtaCare is a task management app that aims to allow caregivers, physicians, and elders to be able to communicate, track medication, create to-do lists, and set appointments to simplify and organize their daily routines.</p>

                        <p>People in need of assistance have trouble keeping track of their schedule, remembering their doctor appointments, forgetting when to take their medication, and knowing who to communicate with when they feel helpless. There is a lack of apps that don’t allow cross-communication from clients to caregivers to physicians. This is important to have access to important medical information, care plans, and organization. </p>

                        <p>The app addresses individuals in need of assistance who often struggle to manage their schedules, recall doctor appointments, medication schedules, and determine whom to contact during moments of vulnerability. Existing solutions fall short, lacking integrated communication channels connecting clients, caregivers, and physicians. The app fills this gap by facilitating cross-communication, ensuring accessibility to crucial medical information, care plans, and overall organizational support.</p>

                    <h3>Research and Users</h3>
                    <h4>Research Process</h4>
                    <p>During the research process, I wanted to find users who found issues with the apps they were using or wanted an app that could benefit them in their everyday lives. So I conducted a survey that asked questions to record users' mobile app habits, what they use, and what they like and dislike about it. I learned that users liked apps to be fast, organized, and feasible. This part of the research was difficult due to having to stay on topic, but I had the user just show me how they use their favorite app and least favorite app and then describe out loud their thought process. I then had them record their answers after finishing the tasks.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Ideate Process</h4>
                    <p>In the ideate process, I went back to look at the answers the users recorded and made a list of mobile app ideas I found interesting, but also where there was a need for improvement. I wrote down a category of people who I found needed to be represented and mobile apps that could be developed. I then looked over the responses to my survey and collaborated on ways to combine the user responses of what needs improvement or what they would like to see (task management, goalkeeping, note-taking). Next, I researched existing mobile apps that mirrored the direction I was going toward and overlooked case studies from product designers who created similar apps.</p>

                    <p>
                        Once the usability issues were resolved, I moved on to design the final screens in Figma. My goal was to create a visual identity that’s aligned with the brand’s values and message, which is: “brand motto”. Also, I’ve checked the competition and took a deep dive into my catalog of references for inspiration.
    
                        What kind of visual style did you follow and why? (Fresh, corporate, dark, light?)
    
                        Did you follow any popular guidelines? (Material Design, iOS Styleguide, etc?)
    
                        What platforms and devices did you design for?
    
                        How does your final design reflect your learnings about your users?

                <p>
                   During this process, I discovered, there are lot of concepts to consider when designing, and researching. For one, it's important to seek out individuals who are in need of assistance, uses task managemnet apps, and understands how to access their information through an app. This helps to identify specific needs and fulfill them based on user needs.
